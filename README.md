Borderlands 3 Savegame Editor
=============================

![screenshot](/doc/screenshot.png)


Work in progress.

Can edit what's exposed in the GUI (so what's in the screenshot).

I have only tested that it writes an identical file when you set the same
values, but I haven't tested that it doesn't fuck up if you set funny values.

If you want a more complete editor and you are okay with using a command line,
try https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3-cli-saveedit

## Windows builds
