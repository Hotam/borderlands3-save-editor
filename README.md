Borderlands 3 Savegame Editor
=============================

![screenshot](/doc/screenshot.png)


Work in progress.

Can edit what's exposed in the GUI, and load and save files.

I have only tested that it writes an identical file when you set the same
values, but I haven't tested that it doesn't fuck up if you set funny values.
